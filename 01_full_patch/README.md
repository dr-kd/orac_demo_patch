# Stealing a patch from the puredata examples.

In order to illustrate how to create a new patch we will convert the patch `D09.shepard.tone.pd` into a fully functional orac patch in such a way that we can run multiple independent instances of the patch in orac.  This is a multi-step process:

## Step 1.  Identify the patch parameters.

So first up we want to grab the example from puredata's documentation.  There are two files - `D09.shepard.tone.pd` and in the same folder `shepvoice.pd`.  While we're here we are going to rename the D09 file to `shep.pd`

-- commit here add the shepard tone files
